Welcome to the new RPKG repository! The code for the GUI has moved to the [glacier-modding/RPKG-GUI](https://github.com/glacier-modding/RPKG-GUI).

This repository contains 2 components - the CLI and the DLL.
The CLI allows you to perform simple operations from a terminal, and the DLL allows you to embed RPKG into your own apps.
